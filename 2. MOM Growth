Scenario 2: Finding Sales Growth
You have a "Sales" table with columns (Date, Revenue). Write a query to calculate the month-over-month revenue growth using a window function.

Date	Revenue
2023-01-01	1000
2023-01-02	1200
2023-01-03	1500
2023-01-04	1800
2023-01-05	2000
2023-01-06	2200


SELECT
    Date,
    Revenue,
        ROUND(
            CASE
                WHEN LAG(CAST(Revenue AS DECIMAL)) OVER (ORDER BY Date) IS NULL THEN NULL
                ELSE ((CAST(Revenue AS DECIMAL) - LAG(CAST(Revenue AS DECIMAL)) OVER (ORDER BY Date)) / LAG(CAST(Revenue AS DECIMAL)) OVER (ORDER BY Date)) * 100
            END, 2
        )
    AS MoM_Growth
FROM
    Sales
ORDER BY
    Date;
